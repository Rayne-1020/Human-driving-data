# Human-driving-data
This dataset was obtained using a 3-channel dash cam that captures footage from the front, interior, and rear views. 
The data includes driving behavior on both freeways and normal urban roads. The freeway data was mainly collected on I-65 between West Lafayette and Indianapolis, while the normal urban road data was primarily collected in West Lafayette and Indianapolis. 
The dataset focuses on key maneuvers such as left and right lane changes, as well as lane-keeping on freeways and urban highways. Additionally, the data collection process included labeling and consideration of weather and light conditions.
The max length of each video is 5 mins and some of the video may not as long as 5 mins.
